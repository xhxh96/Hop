# Hop

Hop is an iOS mobile app that assists users in looking for the cafés that they need. Users are able to search for cafés either using keyword or via location.

The key features of the app are posting of reviews for cafés and updating of café information such as address and amenities.


## Getting Started

The app is fully written in Swift 4.1, targeted to run on iOS 11.4, although the app should work for any iOS devices running iOS 9.0 and above.

The app is however not universal and is thus not officially supported on iPad. 

Backend system of this mobile app is running on MongoDB + NodeJS and managed by @elstonayx. For updates and development of the backend system, please access the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/elstonayx/hopdbserver)

## User Guide
The mobile app can be used with and without an account being created (guest mode)


### Creating an Account
